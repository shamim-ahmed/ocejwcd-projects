          Millions of people around the world lined waterfronts and filled city squares last night 
          to welcome in 2015 with spectacular firework displays as well as traditional events – but
          celebrations in Shanghai were marred by tragedy, as dozens of revellers were killed and 
          injured in a stampede.

          According to Chinese state media, at least 35 people were killed and 42 injured in the 
          crush, which happened in the city’s Bund riverfront area at about 11.30pm local time. 
          Emergency services soon arrived to aid the wounded in Chen Yi Square, an area that often 
          becomes crowded during major events. It was not immediately clear what triggered the 
          stampede.
